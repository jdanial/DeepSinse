# DeepSinse
Code for parameter-free detection/segmentation of single molecule bursts under different noise and acquisition conditions using deep learning.
## Training and validation
To generate ground-truth datasets, train the neural network, validate and test the trained network, please run the `main` code.
## Deployment
To deploy the neural network on experimentally-acquired images (after training), please run the `deploy` code.
## Implementation
For a faster implemention, please check the [StormProcessor](https://github.com/jdanial/DeepSinse/StormProcessor).
